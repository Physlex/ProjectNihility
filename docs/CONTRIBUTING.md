# Welcome to our contributing page
Thanks for joining along on the development of this project! Please make sure before reading ahead, to visit the [README](https://github.com/Physlex/UnnamedProject/blob/main/docs/README.md).

## Before moving on
Due to the lack of funding on our team, and our desire to take things in a more laid-back manner, we are not spending the 16 a month on private organization controls. Hence, it is up to each team member to make sure that they are never pushing, nor merging, to the main branch. When developing code, you are to do so in a branch of your name, and then execute a pull request whenever you finish your code during the next meeting.

## Schedule
Every sunday, at some point, we have a meeting via Discord in the Admin channel. Not every meeting requires every member, and those that do will be specifically announced in the announcements section of the discord. Otherwise, the one leading the meeting will individually tell each member who needs to join and schedule it with them.

The current plan is always denoted by a milestone found in the [issues](https://github.com/Physlex/UnnamedProject/issues) section of the project repository. The schedule roughly adhears to that, alongside each issue having it's own mini-schedule, typically organized into sprints by whoever initiated the exercise.

## Quality and Maintenance
All code entered should be 'green'. That means all unit / integration tests should pass on all of ubuntu / windows / mac operating systems and all extra static analysis tools should return non-error. (This includes style static analysis). Each code piece will be run again during code review on pull request by the reviewer. 

## Push checklist
Assertions: (Must be true)
- [ ] Am I pushing to my named branch?
- [ ] Are all the static analysis tools returning 'green' (see above)
- [ ] Do all non-extractor, non-mutator functions have documentation?
- [ ] Have I added the copyright header notice to every new source code file?
- [ ] Are my files organized? (If you need assistance on this, ask Physlex or another technically experienced individual)

Questions to ask yourself:
- [ ] Does this push increase the quality of the codebase?
- [ ] What does this push accomplish? What issues might this assist in solving?
- [ ] Who should review this?
- [ ] Do I have the most recent copy of main?
- [ ] Does it change the label? Ie. Given that labels are formatted as vA.B.C:
    - A) Do my changes result in a new release?
    - B) Do my changes result in a new feature?
    - C) Do my changes fix a bug?
    - None of the above?

## On commit / merge / pull request messages
Please be descriptive in behavior, and flippant in mechanical detail. We want to know what you changed, how it changed, and where it changed. Detailing each individual changes detail is arbitrary.

### Community Guidelines
Our community guidelines should go without saying in almost all instances. No x-phobic slurs, act like you wish to be treated, respect all those who take time out of their day to work on unpaid programming / art. Almost no one should violate this accidentally. Now, getting heated during a meeting is not the worst thing, especially during an argument, but keep it generally civil.

### Spending Money
Please dont. We want to keep this rather relaxed, and the moment someone spends money on the project it instantly becomes a question as to whether we can make it back. It's our first game and we are making it in 4 months. We can't make it back. So instead of worrying about it, dont!
