# UnnamedProject

## Description
A currently unamed game development project. The primary directive of this project is to learn fundamental game development using unreal engine. Secondary considerations are:
* To become comfortable with computer graphics applications
* To learn basic UI development
* To learn framework - based applications development
* To develop design skills
* To make use of academic knowledge in an applied context
* To just have some fun

The game is under a prototyping phase. No game beta will be released for the forseeable future. Updates will be posted to contributors in the official discord.
